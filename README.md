ToDo List Application with Spring Boot, React, and MySQL
Overview
This guide will walk you through creating a full-stack ToDo List application using Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL as the database. The application will allow users to add, update, delete, and view their tasks.

Backend: Spring Boot
Project Setup:

Initialize a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr with dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Driver.
Use Maven as the build tool and Java as the programming language.
Database Configuration:

Create a new MySQL database named todolist.
Configure the application.properties file to connect to the MySQL database. You will need to specify the database URL, username, and password.
Entity Creation:

Define a TodoItem entity class with fields like id, title, description, and completed. Use JPA annotations to map this class to a database table.
Repository Layer:

Create a repository interface that extends JpaRepository to handle CRUD operations for the TodoItem entity.
Service Layer:

Implement a service class to contain the business logic for managing todo items. This class will use the repository to interact with the database.
Controller Layer:

Develop a REST controller to handle HTTP requests. This controller will expose endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo items.
Testing:

Use Postman to test the API endpoints and ensure they are working correctly.
Frontend: React
Project Setup:

Initialize a new React project using Create React App.
Component Structure:

Create components for different parts of the application, such as TodoList, TodoItem, TodoForm, and TodoTab.
State Management:

Use Reactâ€™s state and context API or Redux to manage the application state, including the list of todo items and their statuses.
API Integration:

Use Axios or the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the Spring Boot backend for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting todo items.
Routing:

Implement routing using React Router to navigate between different views, such as the list of todos and the form to add a new todo.
Styling:

Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components to style the application.
Integration
Frontend and Backend Communication:

Ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend by making API calls to the appropriate endpoints.
State Synchronization:

Keep the frontend state synchronized with the backend data to ensure that the UI reflects the current state of the todo items.
Authentication (Optional):

Implement JWT-based authentication to secure the API endpoints and protect user data.
